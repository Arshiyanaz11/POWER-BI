Project Title: E-Commerce Customer Behavior & Sales Optimization

Objective: 
Analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns to uncover insights that help improve sales strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and increase customer retention.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
Power BI  
Jupyter Notebook  

Project Deliverables:

1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering (Python)  
- Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and treated outliers  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Created new features such as revenue per user, order frequency, and recency

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)  
- Performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis  
- Calculated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)  
- Analyzed cart abandonment behavior and product/category trends

3. Customer Segmentation and Predictive Modeling  
- Applied K-means clustering for customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior  
- Built classification models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict repeat purchases  
- (Optional module) Used Prophet for time-series forecasting of future sales

4. Dashboard and Reporting (Power BI)  
- Developed an interactive dashboard highlighting KPIs such as revenue, AOV, churn rate, and top products  
- Included visuals such as combo charts, scatter plots, maps, and bar graphs  
- Enabled dynamic filtering by country, date, and customer segments

5. Business Recommendations  
- Delivered 5 to 10 actionable insights supported by data analysis  
- Compiled visual summaries and recommendations into a final presentation deck

Learning Outcomes:
- Applied real-world data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling techniques  
- Gained practical experience in exploratory data analysis and clustering  
- Developed business-oriented dashboards using Power BI  
- Learned to translate analytical findings into strategic recommendations
